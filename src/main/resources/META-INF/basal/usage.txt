Usage:
java -jar ${artifactId}-${version}.jar [--package <file>] [-p <port>] [-l <log level>] [<context path>=<war file>]*

port = Port number where the server will listen
log level = The logging level, default is INFO
context path = The context path used for the war
war file = Path to the war file

--package <file>
Creates a new runnable jar containing all the wars and using the options supplied and saves to <file> instead of starting the server.
The resulting file can then be started using only "java -jar <file>"
